# Solar-deeplearning
As the photovoltaic (PV) power has a very low carbon footprint, the use of solar panels is becoming widespread. However, the soiling of solar panels caused by severe weather will reduce up to 50% power generations. This challenge is considered by an existing method for quantifying the solar power loss. Whereas this method utilized a classification method, which is not sufficient for quantification resolution. To solve this, this project makes contribution on modifying the classification problem to a quantile regression problem based on the convolution neural network (CNN), which will increase the resolution of the quantification result.
